# small-bytearray-builder

_This project is no longer being maintained as of Feb. 13, 2024._

This library is a compatibility shim. Use `bytebuild` instead. The name
of this library does not match the GitHub repository name. This is so
that GitHub can redirect `byteverse/small-bytearray-builder` to
`byteverse/bytebuild` for a while. Eventually, this repository will
be renamed.
